Android 5.0 RecyclerViewer
==========================

This sample app accompanies the articles
[CardView](http://developer.xamarin.com/guides/android/platform_features/android_l/cardview) and
[RecyclerView](http://developer.xamarin.com/guides/android/platform_features/android_l/recyclerview).
You can use this sample to learn how to use the new `RecyclerView` widget
introduced in Android 5.0 Lollipop.

This app is a simple "Photo Album Viewer" that lets the user scroll up and 
down to view a collection of photos. Each photo has associated title 
text that describes the photo. Each photo/title combination is 
displayed using a `CardView`, and the app uses a single `RecyclerView` 
instance to hold and display over thirty unique `CardView` instances. A 
basic *adapter* is used to connect the "Photo Album" data with the 
`RecyclerView`.
